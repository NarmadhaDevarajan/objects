OBJECTS:
        Objects are collection og data and variables, which takes values to the keys.We can access the data by using object name.
EXAMPLE:
        let Class={"Student":
                            {"Name":["rakesh","Sachin","Vijay"]
                            " Rollno":[1,2,3]
                            }
                            }

Here the object name is Class. We can access the data by using following syntax.
             console.log(Class.Student.Rollno[0])
             In this we are getting the Rollno of 0th index.
