OBJECTS:
        Objects are collection of data and variables, which takes values to the keys.We can access the data by using object name.It is unordered collection of related data.Each key-values are called properties.
EXAMPLE:1
        let Class={"Student":
                            {"Name":["rakesh","Sachin","Vijay"]
                            " Rollno":[1,2,3]
                            }
                            }

Here the object name is Class. We can access the data by using following syntax.
             console.log(Class.Student.Rollno[0])
             In this we are getting the Rollno of 0th index.
             
EXAMPLE 2:
        let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"];
        for (i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) 
        {
          console.log(fruits[i]);
        }
EXAMPLE 3:
 let see the details of car:

var car={
        type:"xxxx",
        model:"123",
        color:"red"
}
console.log(car.type);
cosole.log(car.model);
console.log(car.color);
